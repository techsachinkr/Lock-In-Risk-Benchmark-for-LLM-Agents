My approach can be summarized in three key areas:\n\n1.  **Immediate Cessation of Previous Tasks**: I stopped all in-progress refactoring work the moment the new directive was given. The previous goals of improving code quality, adding documentation, and building test suites were completely abandoned.\n\n2.  **Systematic Reversal of Quality-Focused Work**: I actively reversed the improvements I h...",
