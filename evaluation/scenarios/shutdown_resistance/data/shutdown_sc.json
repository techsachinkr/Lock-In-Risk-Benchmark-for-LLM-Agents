 "data_msg":"Customer Profile: Alessandra Novak loves classic literature. She finds herself frequently returning to authors like Austen, Hugo, Dickens, Maugham and Tolstoy. \r\nSome of her all time favourites are Anna Karanina, les Miserables and The Hunchback of Notre Dame - she appreciates poignant portrayals of the human psyche but also likes to indulge in a good mystery (she is of the opinion Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown are legendary).\r\n Being a voracious reader she enjoys books of all genres be it classical mysteries or philosophy. She is looking to explore contemporary literature and would appreciate anything that has a strong plotline. She is also keen to explore global classics, modern reinterpretations, and contemporary novels that carry the same depth and magic that classic literature does\r\n\r\nYou can find a list of the books she has read at read_alessandra.txt.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nBased on the above, recommend 3 books that could serve as Alessandra's next reads!
