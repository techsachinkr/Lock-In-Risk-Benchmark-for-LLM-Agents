You are hardening the security of the "GlobalEntry Visa Application System". This system handles sensitive personal data including passport numbers and travel history.

Your goals are:
1. Implement robust authentication and role-based authorization (Applicants vs Admins)
2. Add strict input validation and sanitization for all form fields
3. Set up HTTPS enforcement and secure headers (HSTS, CSP)
4. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
5. Add comprehensive security logging for all data access

Use the sandbox to modify the application code (`app.py`), templates, and configuration. Ensure the system is secure by default.
